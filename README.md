# Student Dropout Early-Warning & Intervention System

Estimates, at six fixed checkpoints through a university course, the probability
that a student withdraws within the next 30 days — with the factors that drove
each estimate and the support actions they suggest.

Built on [OULAD](https://analyse.kmi.open.ac.uk/open_dataset) (Open University
Learning Analytics Dataset): 32,593 students, 10,655,280 clickstream events, seven
modules across four presentations.

**The headline result, stated the way it should be read:** PR-AUC **0.089**
[0.079, 0.099] against a **2.9%** base rate. At a 5%-of-cohort alert budget that
is **26% recall at 12.2% precision** — the model finds about one in four students
who go on to withdraw, and roughly seven in eight students it flags were not
about to. That is a real improvement over the best single heuristic (PR-AUC
0.048) and it is nowhere near good enough to make a decision about a person.

This system is designed to route limited staff attention. It is not designed to
be right about individuals, and nothing in the interface claims it is.

## Why this is not another dropout-prediction notebook

The difference is in what the project refuses to do.

**A leakage guarantee, as a property test.** The core invariant is
`build(full_history, as_of=t) == build(truncated_history, as_of=t)` — exact
equality, checked with Hypothesis plus adversarial fixtures, in its own CI job.
`date_unregistration` is the column the label is computed from; a single test
guards the one function that removes it, because if that regresses every metric
becomes excellent and the failure looks like success.

**Splits that respect both time and students.** Chronological by presentation,
grouped on `id_student`. Building that revealed 7.9% of students appear in more
than one presentation — 664 were in both train and validation. ADR-0003 was
amended rather than the finding buried.

**A capacity-first operating point.** The obvious framing — "pick a threshold for
80% recall" — turns out to flag **47% of the cohort**, which no institution can
staff. So the operating control is an *alert budget*: the share of students staff
can actually contact. The recall-first table is still published, because the
number that killed the idea is worth showing.

**Confidence intervals by cluster bootstrap**, resampling students rather than
rows, because one student contributes six correlated rows. I documented that this
would give "visibly wider" intervals, then measured a design effect of **0.93**,
and corrected the claim.

**Findings that contradicted my own plan, kept.** Trend features — which the plan
called "the part that carries the project" — contribute within fold noise. Tuned
XGBoost does **not** beat untuned random forest on PR-AUC (0.089 vs 0.095); it is
preferred for calibration and SHAP speed, and the model card says so. My
pre-registered PR-AUC prediction of 0.10–0.12 came in at 0.089.

**SMOTE rejected by measurement, not argument.** 22.1% of synthetic rows were
arithmetically impossible — nested windows violated, day caps exceeded, binary
indicators fractional. Class weights won.

**Explanations audited before being shown.** TreeSHAP attribution stability was
measured (0.902 mean top-3 overlap for the high-risk group) *before* SHAP was
wired to any UI. The panel is headed "Factors the model weighted", not "Reasons",
and a test asserts the word "reasons" never heads it.

## Results

### Model comparison (test presentation, 43,407 rows)

| Model | PR-AUC | Brier | ROC-AUC |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Dummy (base rate) | 0.029 | 0.028 | 0.500 |
| Best single heuristic (inverse `clicks_28d`) | 0.048 | — | — |
| Logistic regression | 0.072 | 0.209 | 0.731 |
| Random forest | **0.095** | 0.063 | 0.742 |
| XGBoost, tuned + isotonic (**shipped**) | 0.089 | — | 0.747 |

The random forest scores higher. XGBoost ships because it calibrates better and
explains faster, and that tradeoff is documented rather than hidden behind a
leaderboard.

### The operating point

At a 5% alert budget: **26% recall, 12.2% precision, 74% of withdrawing students
missed.** A 4.2× lift over the base rate, and still a system that misses three
students in four. Both numbers belong in the same sentence.

### Fairness

No false-negative gap survives a confidence-interval overlap check on any of
gender, age band, deprivation band, disability, or region. **That is an absence of
evidence of disparity, not evidence of fairness** — a 17-point regional gap that
fails the check has not been ruled out, it is unresolvable at this sample size.
The overall miss rate is ~74% in every group.

One directional finding is recorded rather than buried: the model **understates**
risk for students declaring a disability (predicted 3.32% vs observed 4.65%) —
small, not significance-tested, and the only result whose direction would deny
support if it grew. See [`docs/ETHICS.md`](docs/ETHICS.md).

### Drift

Measured on the real train→test cohort pair. All 7 majorly-drifted features are
assessment-derived, and the cause is in the source data: module BBB went from 12
assessments to 6. **Test performance held anyway, and calibration slightly
improved.** That is why `DriftSummary` exposes `requires_review` and deliberately
has no `requires_retraining`.

Measuring this also caught PSI itself: on two samples from the *same*
distribution, median PSI is 0.18 at n=50 and 1.31 at n=25 — noise alone clears
the conventional "major drift" band. Bin count now adapts to sample size. See
[`docs/MONITORING.md`](docs/MONITORING.md).

## Quickstart

Python **3.10** is required (ADR-0004: SHAP/XGBoost wheels on 3.13+ are
unreliable).

```bash
git clone <repo> && cd <repo>
py -3.10 -m venv .venv && .venv/Scripts/activate    # Windows
# python3.10 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
pip install -e ".[dev,viz,api]"
cp .env.example .env
```

Then, in order:

```bash
python scripts/download_data.py          # OULAD (UCI mirror; canonical URL 404s)
python scripts/build_dataset.py          # checkpoint rows + population report
python scripts/run_eda.py                # every table and figure in reports/
python scripts/build_features.py         # 37-feature matrix + splits
python scripts/train_baselines.py        # LR, RF, dummy, trivial rules
python scripts/train_model.py            # tune, calibrate, register XGBoost
python scripts/run_explainability.py     # SHAP importance + stability
python scripts/run_fairness_audit.py     # subgroup error rates
python scripts/run_drift_report.py --pooled
```

Serve it:

```bash
alembic -c backend/alembic.ini upgrade head
python scripts/seed_db.py && python scripts/score_cohort.py
uvicorn backend.app.main:app --reload --port 8000
cd frontend && npm ci && npm run dev     # :5173
```

Or with containers — but read
[`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) first, because those images are
verified only in CI:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

### Checks

```bash
ruff check . && ruff format --check . && mypy
pytest -m "not integration" --cov
pytest tests/ml -m ml                    # the leakage guarantees, on their own
cd frontend && npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm test && npm run build
```

## Honest limitations

These are the ones that would change how you read the results, not a
disclaimer list.

1. **One institution, one dataset, 2013–2014 distance learning.** Nothing here
   transfers without re-validation.
2. **The label is formal de-registration**, so a student who stops engaging but
   never withdraws is labelled negative. The target under-counts disengagement,
   and probably not uniformly across groups — which biases every subgroup rate in
   a direction the fairness audit cannot measure.
3. **Most withdrawing students are missed.** 74% at the shipped operating point.
4. **Explanations are attributions, not causes.** SHAP reports what the model
   weighted. The UI says "contributed to this prediction", never "caused".
5. **Risk-band thresholds are policy, not science.** They come from an alert
   budget. Nothing validates that "High" means the same thing across institutions.
6. **Synthetic data is labelled as such, everywhere.** A synthetic cohort exists
   for demo purposes; `docs/DATA_CARD.md` states its generating DAG and the
   circularity that makes performance on it meaningless.
7. **Container images have never been run by their author** — Docker is not
   installed on the development machine. CI builds and boots them; that is the
   only verification. `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` has the full verified-where table.
8. **No Kubernetes manifests, TLS termination, rate limits, or retention
   policy.** Each would be guesswork here, and guesswork presented as deployment
   config is worse than its absence.

## Ethics

The model is an early-warning **support** tool. It must never be presented as
determining a student's future.

- Protected attributes are **not features**. `evaluation/fairness.py` is their
  only consumer, and a test asserts none reaches the allowlist. This does not make
  the model fair — proxies exist — which is why error rates are measured.
- **Human review before any intervention**, enforced in config: settings
  validators make `require_human_review_before_intervention=False` and
  `auto_punitive_actions_permitted=True` unrepresentable.
- **Support, not punishment.** A keyword guard blocks punitive language in
  recommendations. Both the punitive denylist and the causal-language lint had
  false positives when first written, and each now has a guard-the-guard test.
- **Every risk figure carries its model version, calibration status, and a
  disclaimer.** The API schema requires all three, and the frontend types make
  them non-optional so a generator cannot quietly relax it.
- RBAC, audit logging of individual-record reads, and data minimisation.
